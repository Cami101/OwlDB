Hello!

In order to run our tests, we're using a combination of `cypress` and `jest`.

If you have already cloned the repo, make sure to `npm install`.

First, run the server with `npm run start`, then in our folder, run `cypress run`

Also, make sure the URL in the cypress file is correct (Default is http://localhost:1234),
and that the workspaces created by cypress don't already exist.

For the `jest` tests, you can just run `npm run test` as expected. 

Thank you!
